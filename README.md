# Cher-s-Wardrobe-App-from-Clueless-in-Javascript
A fun little project to learn javascript by building Cher's super high tech wardrobe app from the movie 'Clueless'!

## Description

Do you remember this scene from the 90s classic 'Clueless'?

I was just watching it the other day and thought it would be super fun to challenge myself to recreate this incredible high tech wardrobe app! :smile: I have used only HTML, CSS and plain old Javascript, and will be making a javascript tutorial using it.

## Installation

No installation necessary for this one, you can simply open the site on any browser, using the link below:

[Link to the live site](https://cherswardrobe.netlify.app/)


## Usage

Had to be a little creative with the functionality of the app as it's a little unclear from the movie clip! 

Upon opening the link (cherswardrobe.netlify.app) the user will be confronted with a brief hangers video introduction, before accessing the scrolling wardrobe application. There is one viewport for the top and one for the bottom. The user may usethe forward, back and play buttons to make their selections. Once they have found a match, they can press the 'Dress Me' button to see the outfit modelled for them. The user may then refresh the page or select the 'Browse' button to return to their outfit selections.

## Credits

I have aaaaabsolutely nothing to do with the wonderful 90s classic 'Clueless'! That is a movie written and directed by Amy Heckerling and produced by paramount pictures. You can see the moment I'm talking about here in this youtube video, which I also have nothing to do with :grin: :

You can see from this clip I had to be creative with it's functionality, as I'm not quite sure what Cher is doing with the buttons here lol :sweat_smile:

I used Google fonts for the typeface, it was the closest I could find to the original (it's a shame I couldn't find anything closer).
